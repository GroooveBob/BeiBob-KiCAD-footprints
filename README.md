# BeiBob-KiCAD-footprints
Some speacial and standart kicad footprints and symbols i use for building keyboards

# SAFE footprint
SW_Kailh_socket_MX-HotswapSAFE
SW_Kailh_socket_MX_platemountSAFE

A special footprint, when you riped your solder pads for the hotswap sockets of

instead of drillholes i put some drilled pads on the hotswap part of the footprint so uf you rip off the hotswap socket you can just fill the pad with solder and dont have to get a new pcb

**you have to connect the tracks with the drilled pads**
